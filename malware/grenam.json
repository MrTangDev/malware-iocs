  "info": "Win32/Grenam, informally referred to as the V-Virus, is known for recursively enumerating through owned .exe files. It replaces executables with itself and thus makes them inoperable. The threat is most effective in the context of a shared folder, where users mindlessly click on and run executables without checking attributes. The virus recursively enumerates folders on drives beginning with the drive C:. The virus will infect files found on mapped networked and attached drives, provided the security context where the virus was run allows it. The threat renames executable files in your PC to v<file name>.exe (where <file name>.exe is the original file name). Then it copies itself in your PC as <file name>.exe. To prevent you from finding out, when you run the Pintu file disguised as <file name>.exe, it also runs the original file that's been renamed to v<file name>.exe. Some variants use g<file name>.exe.
